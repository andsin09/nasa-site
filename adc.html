        <h1 class = "display-4 text-white">Artemis II</h1>
        <p class="lead text-white">The first, key step to understanding what we are doing is understanding what Artemis II is. Artemis II is a scheduled mission of the Artemis program that NASA runs, and is meant to build up off of the success that Artemis I had brought back in 2022. The missions will be the first crewed one of the Orion spacecraft, and is planned for no earlier than September of 2025. It will be a crew of four astronaunts, venturing around the moon in order to establish a long term presence there for science and exploration. It will last for 10 days, and test NASA's foundations of human deep space exploration with a crew for the first time. What else can we gain from this, you may ask? Well, this deep-space exploration may be able to help us advance our economy and technology for the future, and help us learn if other planets in space are habitable, and thus able to be colonized. We can therefore improve the quality of life on Earth and also ensure that we survive in the future in case of a disastrous event that would force us into the cosmos and onto other planets.</p>

    <div class = "container mt-5">
        <h1 class = "display-4 text-white">ADC</h1>
        <p class = "lead text-white">So, then, what is the ADC? Well, ADC stands for app development challenge. It is a challenge NASA pushes out every year to middle school and high school students, challenging them to use their computer science skills, mathematical skills, and outreach skills. The students form teams with a minimum of six members who must create an application that, this year, relates to the Artemis II mission, and have to solve the technical problems provided. The goal is to build foundational knowledge and introduce students to topics, techniques, and also technologies critical to the Artemis program. Student teams are provided ten weeks to create a video that showcases their created application that visualizes the flight path of Artemis II while also being able to inicate which of SCaN's (NASA's Space Communications and Navigation program) antennas are available to communicate with Earth in real time. The teams that have the top and favorable submissions proceed to advance to present their app in an interview with NASA subject matter experts on the SCaN team. After every top team is interviewed, the true "Top Teams" are gathered for a culminating event in April 2025. </p>

        <h1 class = "display-4 text-white">What is required</h1>
        <p class = "lead text-white">So what are the requirements? Well, taken straight from NASA's ADC information page, student teams from all grade levels must: <br> -Use any programming language (such as Java, C#, C++, Scratch, Python, etc.) to complete the application. <br> -Adhere to the policies of their school districts. <br> -Submit a video of original student-led work about the app. <br> -Complete program requirements as identified by the ADC team <br><br><b> Middle School Teams must create an application that: </b><br> -Displays the path of artemis II by processing and visualizing all provided position data for the mission <br> -Utilize color to represent the different phases of the mission and number of available antennas. <br> -Utilize the SCaN antenna data to display a prioritized list of antennas which have line-of-sight access to Artemis II. <br><br><b>High School Teams must create an application which: </b><br> -displays the path of Artemis II by processing all provided position and velocity data for the mission <br> -Utilize color to represent the different phases of the mission, number of available antennas, and resultant velocity vector <br> -Utilize the Link budget formula and the SCaN antennas data to display a prioritized list of antennas with line-of-sight access to Artemis II.</p>
